The list of changes to the source code (if I remember to put changes here...):


0.2  -- 2015/09/14 and on.

  - Added a CHANGES text file to each project.
  - Changes in 'abc-cryptology': refactoring, new classes, javadoc tweaks everywhere, etc.


0.1  -- anything before 2015/09/14

  - Various changes great and small from the beginning of the project. Really; I'm not going back through my repository
      commits to list them....


0.0  -- oh I forget when.

  - Project initialization. I've been working on these since before I found Gradle; but I converted to the Gradle build
      system sometime after Gradle 2.1 or so.

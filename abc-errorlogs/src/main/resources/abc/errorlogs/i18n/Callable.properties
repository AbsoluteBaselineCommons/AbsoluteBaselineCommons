# A witty "Surprise!" introduction.
callable.intro0=Surprise! Oh, nobody was expecting this to occur; something in the running application has just failed.
# It is possible to see errors while in development of modules ...
callable.intro1=Operating errors might occur while various modular parts of the application are in development mode.
# ... but hopefully not in released modules (continuation of above).
callable.intro2=But, this should be a rare occurrence in stable releases, or hopefully not occurring at all.

callable.intro7=If you are able to find the repository mentioned in the read-me file, please consider posting this log.
# How to report an issue.
callable.intro8=Go to the repository's issue-tracker and create an issue, with the log copy and details on the crash.

callable.intro9=It may be a good idea to look in existing issues, to see if the same problem has already been reported.
# This intro is localized/localizable, to explain the above to users ...
callable.introA=Just one final note: this introduction text is written so it can be localized to a number of languages;
# ... but the remainder of the log after the intro should be in English.
callable.introB=however, a majority of this log should be readable in English, so that our developers can read them.

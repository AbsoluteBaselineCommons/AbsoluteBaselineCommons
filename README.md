# AbsoluteBaselineCommons
The repository of Java libraries containing game-related "commons" modules.

## The Modules.
This bundle of libraries provide a few global categories of functionality.
* *abc-constraints* constrains integer and float values to maximums, minimums, in-range, and boolean comparisons on values.
* *abc-cryptology* provides encryption and decryption of binary-encoded values to keep private data secured.
* *abc-diceroller* rolls randomized values for fictitious "dice" -- useful for role-playing games, or games in general.
* *abc-errorlogs* handles many aspects of outputting various error-data; it contains some special information-collecting classes to gather system data for the log.
* *abc-serializer* provides various additional serialization functionality that is often replicated across many programs and utilities.
* *abc-stringlist* supports managing array lists of strings, such as: lists of nouns (names, places, objects), verbs, adjectives, adverbs, et cetera.

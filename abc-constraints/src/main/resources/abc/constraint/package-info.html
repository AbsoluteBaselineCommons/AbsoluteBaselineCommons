    <h1>abc.constraints</h1>
    This package contains Java class files which provide numeric-constraint methodology. The classes duplicate the same
    methods in each class, returning the respective types: Byte, Double, Float, Integer, Long, and Short types.
    <p/>
    The constraining can be for obtaining a minimum or maximum between two values, or for constraining within a max-min
    range, or boolean conditional methods for determining if a value is within a range or not.
